This repo contails all the details regarding the Dental Clinic Management system made using sql and steamlit

# Libraries

# Things to remember

<li>Step 1:Setting up your Database
 First Create a new database into your local host
 Second import the dental_clinic_databse.sql file from the database folder into the database you just created
 
 **Note:** if you are having any issues with this then you can execute the code in the Dental_clinic_Management.sql file in your local host 
and manually import the data for each table in the order patient-556,doctor-556,appointment-556,treatment-556,review-556,billing-556

<li>Step 2:Running Steamlit 
You can run the steamlit app by typing "streamlit run .\1_ðŸ›Œ_Patient.py" in your terminal 

**Note:** It is importent to remember to not take the files in the Pages folder out and keep all the file together but for them to stay inside the folder

<li>Step 3:operations.sql
You have to run this using sql in CMD all the other intructions are in the file itself in the comments
